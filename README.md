# ops-module


This is the repo for the future ops module.

The idea is to provide basic knowledge on some of the following topics:

1- Networks (how TCP/IP works, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS)
2- Basic Linux commands
3- Light intro into virtualization, containers. Maybe some AWS
4- Continuous integration and devops stuff
