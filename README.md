# ops-module


This is the repo for the future ops module.

The idea is to provide basic knowledge on some of the following topics:

1- Networks (how TCP/IP works, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS)

2- Basic Linux commands

3- Light intro into virtualization, containers. (AWS free tier)

4- DevOps: Create a simple pipeline from scratch using GitHub and CircleCI.
